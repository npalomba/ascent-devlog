        Ascent will (hopefully) be an interesting game. I built my videogame culture around <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania">
        metroidvanias</a> and I absolutely love this genre, I've played every single Metroid game and what I love the most about
        the series (and about the genre) is the sense of discovery they deliver to the player. It's always a great experience to
        explore an unknown world and open new paths that were previously unaccessable; sometimes I would love to have an infinite
        world to roam in.

            <p class = "imageCaption">Super Metroid, one of the best games I've ever played</p>
        </div>

        Unfortunately, it is impossible to have such a huge map. But it is possible to give the illusion of something infinite:
        procedural generation is the answer. It is also a thing that really fascinates me, I like to think of it like a computer
        finally being able to make something creative, with some help from the programmer :)<br>
        It is also a great way to improve someone's programming skills and it sometimes leads to unexpected results.

        <h2 class = "logSubtitle">Ascent: basic structure</h2>

        You've probably already guessed that Ascent will be a Metroidvania with procedurally generated elements. My plan is
        to use a fixed map, that I will personally design, along with a procedurally generated area (one for each hand-drawn zone).
        As the player completes those levels, their size and their difficulty increases, but items become rarer and so is
        the final rewards; secondary missions will also be set in these areas.
        <br><br>
        I've already started building a level generator! At the moment it is a pretty basic tool, it just generates rooms and
        corridors, but, for example, doesn't handle collisions between rooms. Which may not necessarily be a bad thing, but
        the problem is that I have no control over this issue, which may happen when I don't want it to.


        <div class = "captionedImage">
            <img class = "singleLogImage" src = "../imgs/0001ascent/generator.png"/>
            <p class = "imageCaption">A simple level created by my <a href = "https://github.com/unsettledgames/RoomGenerator">generator</a></p>
        </div>

        The procedurally generated areas will be accessible from the last settlements, inhabited by the last people on Earth: in these places
        you will be able to purchase items that will be useful for your journey, and you will also meet new people, that may help you
        in your adventure...or not :P

        <h2 class = "logSubtitle">Ascent: mechanics</h2>

        The game will be based on two main features: Alice's shield and hacking. With the shield, the player can both shot projectiles
        and defend him/herself (in Italian we don't have this distinction!). Additionally, it is possible to parry attacks and send
        them back to the opponent: a smart use of the shield can really make your life easier.

        <div class = "captionedImage">
            <img class = "singleLogImage" src = "../imgs/0001ascent/idle.png"/>
            <p class = "imageCaption">Alice with her shield</p>
        </div>

        The second mechanic, which must be still carefully designed, is hacking. If you succeed in solving a little challenge,
        you will be able to stun an enemy and, if you've been very fast or precise, you can also take control of it. That means
        that you are able to use the attacks of the enemy that you're controlling: of course, the more powerful a foe is, the
        more difficult the puzzle will be.<br>
        Hacking will also be very useful to manipulate the environment and to get rid of obstacles that may get in your way.

        <h2 class = "logSubtitle">Story</h2>

        I don't really want to tell you anything particular about the story. I'm sadistic. Joking, I just think that it will be a better experience
        if you find out about the plot on your own :) <br>
        All I can say is that Alice is the hero that will have to save humankind. Why? Because of a disaster. Where? Here, on Earth.
        When? In an unfortunately not too far future.

        <h2 class = "logSubtitle">End of log 1</h2>
        So, what do you think about my ideas? I'm very determined in implementing them, and I can't wait to make more progress in this
        project. I hope that you feel the same :)
        <br>Feel free to tell me your opinion in the comment section! Have a nice day, see you in the next log!
