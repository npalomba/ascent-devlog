        Hi everyone! So, yeah, I'm making a game. And, from now on, I want to tell you EVERYTHING about it,
        since it's basically starting to be one of the most interesting things I'm making in my life
        (yeah, try to imagine the rest!). Jokes aside, I would like to introduce myself and to tell you how this
        journey started :)

        <h2 class = "logSubtitle">whoami</h2>

        My name is Nicola and I'm a 19 years old computer science student based in Italy.
        I started painting when I was 7 years old, so I've always been in close contact with the art world,
        which is, still nowadays, one of my strongest passions. At the age of 12 (11? 13? I don't remember)
        I started messing around with FL Studio: at that time I was a huge fan of mainstream EDM music, Skrillex,
        Nicky Romero, Knife Party and Avicii were some of my favourite artists, and I still have lots of their songs
        in my MP3 player. I was trying to emulate their stuff, while trying to find my style and while making from
        2 to 3 paintings during a year. I then started studying computer science at school, until I learnt enough
        to understand the power of videogames as an expressive mean.

        <div class = "captionedImage">
            <img class = "singleLogImage" src = "../imgs/0000letsgo/gris.jpg"/>
            <p class = "imageCaption">I find Gris to be one of the best examples of videogames as an art form.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class = "logSubtitle">Genesis</h2>

        There's a quite clever guy in my class, who invested lots of money in cryptocurrencies and stuff like that,
        in order become reach and finally be able to achieve its goals. That was not the only way for him to try to
        make money, so he once asked me if I was willing to help him make a videogame: he would have done the programming
        and I would have taken care of art and music. So I said "Ok, how are we going to split our earnings?" and he replied
        "You'll get 15%" O.O

        Seriously? 15% for all the art and music? I tried to convince him to be more reasonable, but there was no way to
        change his idea. So I told myself "Well, I guess it's time for me to make something big". I spent something like 2
        months practicing pixel art (which is a style that I love, probably also for the bit of nostalgic feel that it
        comes with) and making researches about the subject. And I eventually came up with this.

        <div class = "captionedImage">
            <img class = "singleLogImage" src = "../imgs/0000letsgo/column.png"/>
            <p class = "imageCaption">Pretty horrible, uh?</p>
        </div>

        I guess we all started somewhere. Luckily, I feel like I've improved a lot since then, I made a few simple
        projects with Unity and now I feel confident enough to definitely start my journey.

        <h2 class = "logSubtitle">Ascent</h2>

        I want to sum up all the things I love in my life into a videogame: its name will be Ascent. The story is
        already pretty much decided, the mechanics are clear in my mind. What is still missing are...well,
        lots of scripts and art. And since I'm very interested in how other people solve problems,
        I thought that, maybe, I'm not the only one. I will absolutely tell you more in future posts,
        in the meantime I would like to present you Alice, the main character of Ascent.

        <div class = "captionedImage">
            <img class = "singleLogImage" src = "../imgs/portrait.png"/>
            <p class = "imageCaption">Say hello!</p>
        </div>

        Our journey begins now. And I hope you will join me in this adventure :)
