        As soon as I wrote the first version of my player controller, I stumbled on a weird bug. Alice would sometimes
        get stuck between tiles, even though I had attached a material with 0 friction to her colliders and to the colliders
        of the tiles.

        <div class = "captionedImage">
            <img class = "singleLogImage" src = "../imgs/0003tileunifier/stuck.gif"/>
            <p class = "imageCaption">She would just get stuck between the two box colliders</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "captionedImage">
            <img class = "singleLogImage" src = "../imgs/0003tileunifier/colliders.png"/>
        </div>

        Creating my levels in Aseprite (the pixel art editor I use) and then adding colliders via Unity would have been just
        a temporary solution, and only for the levels made by me: the procedurally generated parts are necessarily made of
        single tiles, so, eventually, I would have got the same problem.

        <h2 class = "logSubtitle">Changing collider</h2>

        I partially solved the problem by changing the collider used by Alice to trigger contact with the ground, which,
        at the beginning, was a box collider. A circle collider (or a capsule collider, the concept is the same) helped a lot:
        since they have no edges, they can't get stuck between tiles.

        <div class = "captionedImage">
            <img class = "singleLogImage" src = "../imgs/0003tileunifier/circle.png"/>
        </div>

        But, exactly when I thought the problem was definitely solved, I discovered a new bug: sometimes, the run animation is interrupted
        and then immediately resumed. This means Alice still gets stuck between tiles, but probably the force applied to the sprite is enough
        to unstuck her. <br>
        This would be so easy, if only we used a single, continuous collider! The great thing is that it is possible to unify
        the single tiles' colliders.

        <h2 class = "logSubtitle">Tile unifier!</h2>

        Each tile prefab comes with a TileUnifier, which is a script that automatically creates a single collider starting from multiple
        PolygonCollider2Ds. The idea is pretty naive, but it unexpectedly works! I basically divide a level between rows and columns: the first
        tile extends its collider so that it incorporates the other ones.<br>

        Firstly, every tile checks if it has other tiles around it, so that it can understand whether it's part of a wall, of the ground
        or of the ceiling and if it is the first tile of the series.
        In that case, it throws longer and longer raycasts until it hasn't reached the end of the tile series. Every time a tile is hit,
        its collider is disabled and the first one's is extended.
        <br>
        Here's the final result:

        <div class = "captionedImage">
            <img class = "singleLogImage" src = "../imgs/0003tileunifier/fullcolider.png"/>
            <p class = "imageCaption">As you can see, the collider now includes the other tiles</p>
        </div>

        This was a pretty short log, but I think this is a pretty useful tricks if you have to deal with multple colliders in tile-based
        levels. I hope you learnt something new, have a nice day and see you in the next log!
